# CMR GraphQL Python Client

This client is used to interface NASA's Common Metadata Repository (CMR).

## Installation
To install this library locally, run the following command:

`python setup.py install`

This should create a directory structure like the following locally:

```
python_graphql_client
    -build 
        -lib
            -CMRGraphQLClient.py
    -examples
    ...
```
This should also add the CMR GraphQL Client package to your default Python Package library locally.

## Examples

For example usage of the CMR GraphQL Client Python package, see the Jupyter Notebook example within the examples directory.
